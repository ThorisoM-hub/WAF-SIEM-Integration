# WAF + SIEM Integration Project: ModSecurity & Splunk

## Overview

This project integrates **ModSecurity** (a Web Application Firewall) with **Splunk** (a Security Information and Event Management platform) to create a real-time security monitoring system for web applications. The setup is optimized for an Intel Celeron, 8 GB RAM system, using **XAMPP** for Apache, with ModSecurity for WAF protection, and Splunk for log aggregation and alerting.

## Features

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** powered by **ModSecurity**.
- **SIEM** functionality using **Splunk Free Version** for log aggregation, searching, and alerting.
- **OWASP Juice Shop** as a target application for attack simulation.
- Protects against common attacks like **SQL Injection** and **XSS**.
- Automated log forwarding from **ModSecurity** to **Splunk**.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **XAMPP** for Apache (Web server).
- **ModSecurity** for Apache (Web Application Firewall).
- **Splunk Free Version** for SIEM.
- **OWASP Juice Shop** for attack simulation.

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the WAF + SIEM integration:

### Step 1: Install XAMPP (Apache Web Server)
1. Download and install **XAMPP** from the [official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
2. Start **Apache** in the XAMPP Control Panel.

### Step 2: Install ModSecurity
1. Download and install **ModSecurity** for Apache.
2. Edit `httpd.conf` to load the **mod_security2.so** module and include the `modsecurity.conf` file.
3. Configure ModSecurity rules, including OWASP **Core Rule Set** (CRS).

### Step 3: Install Splunk Free Version
1. Download and install **Splunk** from [Splunk's official website](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download.html).
2. Set up **HTTP Event Collector (HEC)** to collect ModSecurity logs.

### Step 4: Test the Setup
1. Simulate attacks using **OWASP Juice Shop** and monitor how **ModSecurity** blocks them.
2. Forward **ModSecurity logs** to **Splunk** using a batch script.

### Step 5: Monitor Logs in Splunk
1. View ModSecurity logs in the **Splunk Search & Reporting** dashboard.
2. Set up alerts for detected attacks.

## Skills Learned

- **Security Analyst (Investigation Level)**:
  - Working with **ModSecurity** to defend against web application attacks.
  - Integrating **Splunk** for security log management and alerting.
  - **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, and other common web attacks.
  
- **Incident Response**:
  - Real-time monitoring of web application security events.
  - Analyzing attack patterns and using alerts to trigger responses.

- **Log Aggregation & Management**:
  - Using **Splunk** to manage large volumes of security logs.
  - Visualizing attack data through Splunk's search and reporting interface.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to integrate a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** with a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** platform for **real-time threat detection** and **incident response**.

By following this guide, youâ€™ve learned how to:

1. Set up **ModSecurity** for **WAF protection**.
2. Configure **Splunk** for **SIEM functionality**.
3. Simulate common web application attacks and detect them in **Splunk**.

With this knowledge, you are better prepared for **Security Operations Center (SOC)** roles, including skills in **incident investigation**, **log analysis**, and **alert management**.

Feel free to explore the project further or contribute by improving the integration or adding new security features!

### **How This Demonstrates WAF Effectiveness**

The project not only shows how **ModSecurity** is set up to protect against common attacks but also demonstrates its effectiveness by including screenshots of actual attacks being blocked, such as **SQL Injection** and **XSS**, and how **Splunk** picks up and alerts on those blocked attacks. These images make it clear that the WAF is functioning correctly and the SIEM integration allows for proper monitoring and alerting.

This **README.md** now includes everything necessary for users to understand the project setup, how to implement it, and how to verify that the **WAF** is effectively blocking attacks, with **clear visual demonstrations** at the end. Let me know if you need any further adjustments or additions!
